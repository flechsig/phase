Introduction
============

PhasesStation is a bootable iso image containing phase and basic linux distribution. The iso image can be burned onto a cd, copied to a usb stick, run in a virtual machine or boote from a boot manager like grub.
To produce the iso image we the kiwi tool. With Kiwi it is possible to make a custom linux distribution. Kiwi is based on OpenSuse but the package can also be used on other rpm based distributions. As an alternative option and for testing it is possible to use the online tool SuseStudio. The difficulties for phase are the requirement of packages which are not available as rpms like the fortran compiler, hdf5, root... In principle we can make rpms from these packages but also the rpms must be maintained. We follow a simplified approach and clone an existing Suse linux installation with phase. We take only the absolute minimum of packages into our distribution and copy the additonal shared libs into a common plase (/usr/local/lib).

BUILD
=====

The PhaseStation directory contains the control files for kiwi and the the shell script build_PhaseStation.sh. We recommend to copy build_PhaseStation.sh to mybuild_PhaseStation.ch. At the beginning of the script there are some variables which must be adjusted. For speed in particular during debugging it is recommended to use a local copy of the installation repository but remote repositories can also be used. We need two additional folders with sufficient free space- one for the final result (the iso file) and one for the intermediate distribution. The script is well commented the adaptation should be straight forward.
